His skin, a rich ebony characteristic of his drow heritage, is smooth and unmarred, hinting at both his elven longevity and meticulous self-care.

His eyes are a mesmerising shade of violet, sharp and calculating, holding a depth of intelligence and menace. They pierce through those who meet his gaze, leaving them feeling exposed and vulnerable. His high cheekbones and angular features enhance his air of regality and command. His expression is often one of serene control, masking the malevolence that lies beneath.

Lezlyr's attire is the epitome of sophistication. He prefers a dark purple velvet suit that fits his slender frame with impeccable precision, exuding both wealth and power.

His hands are usually gloved in fine black leather, which not only complements his outfit but also adds to his enigmatic presence.

His voice is a silky baritone, smooth and persuasive, capable of charming even the most resolute individuals. Each word is carefully chosen, dripping with a mix of sincerity and hidden intent. He moves with the grace of a predatory feline, every step calculated and deliberate. A master manipulator, Lezlyr has an uncanny ability to read people, effortlessly exploiting their fears and desires to bend them to his will.

Despite his refined exterior, there is an ever-present aura of danger around him. He is a consummate puppeteer, orchestrating events from the shadows with a delicate touch. His knowledge of dark magic is profound, and he does not hesitate to use it to eliminate obstacles. The rings on his fingers, each inscribed with arcane symbols, are a testament to his magical prowess.

Lezlyr is a master of psychological warfare, often leaving his victims questioning their sanity before delivering the final blow.

### Backstory

Lezlyr Helivar Tyth Aleandius was born into the grime of Zakuul’s backstreets—a place where hope was scarce, and dreams were fragile. His father, once a proud artisan, vanished one stormy night, leaving behind a grieving mother and a sister, Elowen, whose lungs were cursed by some unseen malady. Lezlyr’s days were spent hunched over his shoe shine box, eavesdropping on tales spun by sailors, beggars, and merchants.

One fateful evening, an old sailor named Captain Thorne shared a forbidden legend—the Mirror of Tarnus. It was said to lie hidden in the heart of the Whispering Forest, a place where shadows whispered secrets and reality blurred. The mirror, Captain Thorne claimed, granted wealth and power beyond imagination. Lezlyr’s heart raced. If he could find it, he could save Elowen.

Driven by desperation, Lezlyr embarked on his voyage. He promised Elowen he’d return before she noticed his absence. But fate conspired against him—a tempest-tossed his ship off course, and a year slipped away like sand through his fingers. When he finally staggered back to Zakuul, he found Elowen’s room empty, her bed neatly made.

Despair clawed at his chest. Elowen had waited for him to leave, sparing him the agony of witnessing her last breath. At that moment of grief, the Mirror of Tarnus whispered—a voice like silk and shadows. It promised solace, a chance to reunite with Elowen. Lezlyr listened, desperate for any hope.

The mirror’s gifts flowed like poisoned honey. Lezlyr became a master of deception, manipulating nobles and merchants. His shoe shine box was replaced by velvet gloves, and his once-worn shoes now bore the insignia of the elite. But the mirror’s hunger grew. It demanded more—more souls, more sacrifices.

Lezlyr’s descent was swift. He silenced rivals, betrayed friends, and amassed wealth. The mirror revelled in his transformation, whispering secrets of forbidden magic. Lezlyr’s eyes glowed with violet fire, and he wove spells that bent reality. His sister’s memory faded, replaced by ambition.

The mirror’s final promise came—an ancient wish scroll, capable of reviving the dead. Lezlyr’s heart clenched. Elowen’s face haunted him—the way she’d smiled, the warmth of her touch. He vowed to find the scroll, to undo the cruel twist of fate that had stolen her from him.
