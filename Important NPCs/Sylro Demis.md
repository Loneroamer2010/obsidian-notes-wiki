Standing at an impressive 6'2", Sylro Demis exudes an air of dignified grace characteristic of his wood elf heritage. His dark brown skin, a testament to his long years, is smooth and unblemished, radiating a quiet strength. Short black hair, styled in a neat tapered fade, frames his face, complementing his well-defined features. His dark brown eyes, calm and observant, miss nothing in his surroundings, always ready to offer a reassuring glance or a scrutinizing stare.

Demis's attire is always impeccable, reflecting his meticulous nature. He favours long black pants secured with a brown leather belt, paired with a rolled-up white long-sleeved button-up shirt. The top few buttons of his shirt are undone, adding a touch of casual elegance to his otherwise formal ensemble. Over this, he wears a fitted grey vest that accentuates his tall, lean frame. A polished silver watch adorns his left wrist, a symbol of both his punctuality and refined taste. Often, he can be seen carrying a finely crafted violin, an instrument he plays with remarkable skill, adding a layer of artistic sophistication to his persona.

Cleanly shaven, Demis presents a picture of precision and care. His movements are deliberate and smooth, revealing his well-practiced poise. His posh British accent carries a tone of authority and respect, commanding attention without demanding it. Despite his formal demeanour, there is a warmth in his interactions, especially when he insists on being addressed simply as "Demis."

Demis embodies the qualities of a steadfast and reliable ally, his calm presence and sharp mind making him a pivotal figure in any situation. His attire and mannerisms speak volumes about his character—disciplined, attentive, and unwaveringly loyal.

### Backstory

Sylro Demis, a wood elf of dignified grace, was born into a family of travelling bards, akin to a circus troupe, who brought joy and music to towns and cities across the land. Growing up, he learned the art of performance and the beauty of music, mastering the violin under his parents' tutelage. However, as he matured, Demis yearned for a life that contrasted with the nomadic lifestyle of his family. He desired stability, structure, and a sense of permanence.

When his family’s travels brought them to Neverwinter, Demis decided to stay behind. Enchanted by the city's vibrant culture and opportunities, he sought to carve out a life for himself there. His talent with languages and music, along with his impeccable manners, soon found him work in various establishments, where he honed his skills in etiquette and service.

Years later, when a fledgling adventuring company was formed, Demis saw an opportunity to establish a stable and fulfilling career. Initially hired as a cleaner, his dedication, intelligence, and calming presence quickly earned him the role of butler and desk clerk. Living in the attic of the company's headquarters, Demis became an indispensable part of the team, managing the household, handling correspondence, and providing invaluable support.
