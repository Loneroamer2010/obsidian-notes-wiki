Brannwyn Lutgehr is a sharp-witted and skilled blacksmith, known for her fiery personality and exceptional weapon craftsmanship. As the owner of [[Brannwyn's Sharp Edge]] in Neverwinter’s Chasm District, she has quickly built a reputation for creating reliable and deadly weapons. Unlike her brother Brannur, Brannwyn’s shop may lack meticulous cleanliness, but her swords and other weapons are renowned for their sharpness, balance, and sturdiness. Her quick wit and verbal jabs make her shop an entertaining yet challenging place for customers, especially those who are easily offended. Despite occasional confusion from the city’s procurement staff, who sometimes treat her and her brother’s shops as a single entity, Brannwyn stands out as a distinct and formidable presence in Neverwinter’s burgeoning blacksmithing scene.
