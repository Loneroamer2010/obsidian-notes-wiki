Captain Harrag is a burly, hairy man with only one leg (he lost the other in a fight with sahuagin). He has a fearsome and gruff exterior, but those who know him closest are aware that the man possesses an impressive amount of compassion and empathy. [[The Beached Leviathan]] is a true labour of love for the Captain, and he takes immense pride in the establishment. That said, Harrag is no pushover. Harrag will not shy away from securing good deals for his business even if the tactics demand he be cut-throat. Likewise, those that threaten the establishment will be swiftly and strongly dealt with. ![[Captain Harrag.png]]
