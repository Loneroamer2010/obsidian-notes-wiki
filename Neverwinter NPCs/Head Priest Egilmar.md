Head Priest Egilmar is the esteemed leader of the [[Temple of Neverwinter]]. An old human with honey-coloured skin, Egilmar exudes an aura of wisdom and mystery. His long dreadlocks, streaked with black and white from age, cascade down his back, symbolizing a lifetime of devotion and spiritual insight.

Egilmar is always seen wearing dark grey robes, a deliberate choice to avoid showing favouritism towards any specific deity. This neutrality allows him to serve as a unifying figure within the temple, embodying the inclusive spirit that the Temple of Neverwinter represents.

Egilmar speaks in a dreamy, almost otherworldly manner, as if constantly immersed in divine visions. This ethereal quality to his speech adds to his mystique, leaving many to wonder if his insights are the result of profound spiritual connection or perhaps something more earthly. Despite his revered position, Egilmar's enigmatic demeanour and universal faith practice have garnered mixed opinions among the other head priests.

Little is known about Egilmar's past, and any attempt to question him about it is met with his standard reply: "I am of and for the gods; my past and future are in their hands alone." This enigmatic response only adds to the air of mystery surrounding him and fuels further speculation about his true origins.

Notably, [[Lady Jasmine]] and some others harbour a degree of scepticism towards Egilmar. They argue that a man who professes to follow all faiths equally cannot be wholly trusted. This undercurrent of suspicion is further fuelled by Egilmar's seemingly aloof and elusive nature. While he appears to be a benign and visionary leader, there are whispers and subtle doubts about his true intentions and loyalties within the temple's inner circles.

Nevertheless, Egilmar remains a central figure in the Temple of Neverwinter, guiding its diverse congregation with a gentle hand and an enigmatic smile, fostering an environment where all faiths can coexist in harmony.
