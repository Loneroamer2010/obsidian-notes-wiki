Swift Heart now has a relaxed and empathetic disposition, but she will be the first to tell you that she was a passionate adventure-seeker in her youth. Sheâ€™ll gladly tell you a tale or two about her dangerous treks through jungles filled with giant venomous snakes, near-death experiences wandering in endless desert dunes, or even times spent on the high seas with her Tabaxi sea captain friend, Stands in Tar.
