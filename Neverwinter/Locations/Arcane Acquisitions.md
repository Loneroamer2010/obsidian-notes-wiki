Arcane Acquisitions is a shop that sells magical arms and armour located in the Chasm district. The shop is generally very easy to locate, as it will generally be emanating a bright purple, green, or blue glow from one of its many forges and braziers (much to the chagrin of its neighbours). Approaching the shop, a customer will generally hear the banging of hammer on anvil, the hiss of steam valves being released from the many stills and alchemical contraptions, or the roar of seemingly-magical flames.

The shop is run by the eccentric half-elf Wizard named [[Flinar Ralolar]]. Flinar wears a robe and goggles around his shop, where he quietly toils away with a perpetual frown on his face. His assistant, a goblin by the name of [[Flinar Ralolar|Gigz]], performs most of the mundane blacksmithing at the shop. Patrons will never, however, hear Flinar and Gigz conversing as Flinar chooses to telepathically communicate with his assistant.

Flinar offers a variety of magical weapons, armour, and items that he crafts in his workshop. He does not generally take requests or commissions, instead, offering only what he was already created. Some speculate the store is more of a research laboratory for the wizard, and he only chooses to sell his goods to make room for new research.
