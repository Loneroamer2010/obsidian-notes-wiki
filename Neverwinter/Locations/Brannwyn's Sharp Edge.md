Brannwyn’s Sharp Edge, located next door to [[Brannur's Forge]] in Neverwinter’s Chasm District, is a haven for weapon enthusiasts and warriors alike. The shop is filled with an array of finely-crafted weapons, from sharp swords to balanced axes, all forged with exceptional care and skill. Unlike her brother’s immaculate store, [[Brannwyn Lutgehr]]’s shop has a more rugged atmosphere, reflecting the nature of the deadly tools it offers.

Despite the lack of meticulous cleanliness, the quality of Brannwyn’s weapons is unmatched, earning her a growing reputation among Neverwinter’s defence forces. The city's procurement staff have sometimes mistaken Brannwyn’s Sharp Edge and Brannur’s Forge as a single entity, leading to joint orders for both armour and weapons.

The name “Sharp Edge” aptly describes not only the superbly crafted weapons but also the shop’s ambiance. Customers may experience Brannwyn's quick wit and sharp demeanour, adding a lively edge to their shopping experience. For those seeking reliable, high-quality weapons, Brannwyn’s Sharp Edge is the go-to destination in Neverwinter.
