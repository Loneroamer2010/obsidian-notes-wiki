Fisher’s Float is an earthmote just southwest of Neverwinter that a hearty guild of fishermen has made their home and business headquarters. The homes and warehouses visible on the earthmote are austere by all accounts. The small, wooden shanties certainly imply that the fishers and sailors that call the Float their home are not living indulgent lifestyles. While these fishermen peacefully supply a massive portion of Neverwinter’s seafood, they also manage to keep largely to themselves. As a result, there exist plenty of rumours about the goings-on of Fisher’s Float. One particularly prevalent rumour is that the residents of Fisher’s Float are in some form of allegiance with evil [[Gods of the Multiverse|sea gods]] and/or sea monsters.
