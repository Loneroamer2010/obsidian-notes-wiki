Run by [[Venrie Fuvont]], Fuvont's Mounts and Tack stable stands as a serene haven for adventurers and travellers alike. The stable's exterior boasts intricately carved wooden beams, depicting scenes of majestic horses and mythical creatures, hinting at the treasures within. A hand-painted sign hangs above the entrance, warmly inviting patrons inside.

Stepping through the sturdy oak doors, visitors are greeted by the comforting scent of fresh hay and polished leather. The spacious interior is meticulously organized, with rows of finely crafted saddles, bridles, and other tack lining the walls. Each item is displayed with care, showcasing the high quality and craftsmanship that the store is known for. Stalls filled with well-groomed mounts—from sturdy draft horses to sleek, swift steeds—create a sense of calm and order. The gentle sounds of contented animals and the occasional clink of metal add to the ambiance, making it clear that this is a place where both mounts and their riders are well cared for.
