Neverdeath consisted of two wide, roughly square areas of the city surrounded by a thick and looming black wall of stone and wood pierced by stark black gates. Each of these was a sprawling cemetery: the so-called Main Graveyard was located as the northeastern of the two sections, while the southwestern section was known as the 

Pauper's Section. The graveyards included sprawling rows of tombstones interspersed with old trees, crumbling statues, and mausoleums. These mausoleums were interconnected via underground catacombs that extended under both cemeteries.

The graveyard was considered sacred to [[Gods of the Multiverse|Kelemvor]], and [Doomguides](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Doomguide "Doomguide") from the Eternal Order of Kelemvor were responsible for protection of the area.

Both sections of Neverdeath were strongly affected by the Spellplague. In addition to physically altering the landscape of the graveyard, the corpses now spring back to life and attack visitors. Tall walls protect the horrors of the graveyard from attacking the city, and Neverwinter’s residents know to stay well away from the horrors that await within. The people of Neverwinter now burn their dead.
