Priscilla’s Perfumes and Potables is owned and operated by a young human woman who goes simply by “[[Priscilla]]” — never a last name given. The beautiful shop, located in the Bluelake District, has floor-to-ceiling shelves filled with fresh flowers and glass bottles of vibrantly coloured liquids. In fact, there are so many flowers in this shop that a number of newcomers have mistaken it for a florist. All the cabinetry in the shop is ornately crafted and polished to a shine. 

While the shop’s name may seem to indicate that it is focused around perfumes and fragrant beverages, Priscilla is an extremely talented alchemist and apothecary. She is capable of making exotic and rare concoctions for the right price. She also has some talent in diagnosing maladies, though she generally doesn’t offer those services unless asked explicitly. 

All the same, her shop is absolutely befitting of the Bluelake District’s desire to be restored to noble estates and households. The more-wealthy residents of Neverwinter all know of Priscilla and frequent her shop for both her potions and finely-crafted fragrances. The poorer residents of Neverwinter may not know of the shop, but will absolutely know of Priscilla herself and her supposed “miracle” cures.
