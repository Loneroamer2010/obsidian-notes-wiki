The Camp of Silvanus is a tranquil and secluded haven nestled in the southwest-most edge of the Neverwinter Wood, just north of the [[Neverwinter River]]. Surrounded by towering trees and vibrant undergrowth, the camp serves as an extension of the [[Temple of Neverwinter]], offering worshippers a place to connect deeply with nature. The centrepiece of the camp is a simple yet sacred altar made of living wood and stone, set in a natural clearing where sunlight filters through the canopy.

Scattered around the clearing are a few well-maintained tents, providing shelter for those who wish to stay longer and immerse themselves in the serenity of the forest. The camp is a place of quiet reflection and communion with the natural world, where the sounds of rustling leaves, chirping birds, and flowing water create a soothing symphony. Here, followers of Silvanus can perform rituals, meditate, and find peace in the untouched beauty of the wilderness.
