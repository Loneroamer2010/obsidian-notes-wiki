The Room of [[Gods of the Multiverse|Cyric]] in the [[Temple of Neverwinter]] is a shadowy and enigmatic chamber dedicated to the god of strife, lies, and deception. As you step into this space, the air grows colder, and the light dims, creating an atmosphere of mystery and intrigue. The walls are adorned with dark, intricate murals that depict scenes of conflict, betrayal, and chaos, all rendered in shadowy hues. Flickering torches cast eerie, shifting shadows across the room, enhancing the sense of unease.

Central to the room is a dark, obsidian altar, where offerings and rituals to Cyric are performed. The altar is surrounded by hidden alcoves and 09secret compartments, symbolizing the deceptive and elusive nature of the god. The room features several intricate illusions, created by the skilled priests, that play tricks on the eyes and senses, reminding visitors of the deceptive power of Cyric. The dim lighting and shifting shadows make it difficult to discern what is real and what is illusion. This room also honours [[Gods of the Multiverse|Bane, god of tyranny; Beshaba, goddess of misfortune; Loviatar, goddess of pain; and Mask, god of thieves]], as their domains align closely with the themes of strife, deception, and conflict.

The head priest of Cyric's room leads rituals that often involve elements of misdirection and secrecy, emphasizing the themes of strife and deception. The room also serves as a place of counsel for those seeking to understand the darker aspects of human nature or to navigate the complexities of deceit and conflict in their lives. Despite its foreboding atmosphere, the Room of Cyric provides a necessary space for worshippers to confront and reflect on the darker elements of existence and the pervasive influence of strife and lies.
