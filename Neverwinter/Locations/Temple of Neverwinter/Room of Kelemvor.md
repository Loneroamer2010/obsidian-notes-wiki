The Room of [[Gods of the Multiverse|Kelemvor]] in the [[Temple of Neverwinter]] is a solemn and reflective space dedicated to the god of the dead. As you enter, the atmosphere grows quiet and contemplative, befitting a place of reverence for the passage from life to death. The walls are adorned with intricate murals depicting various afterlives and hells, showcasing the diverse destinies that await souls based on their deeds in life. These depictions serve as a reminder of the judgement and balance that Kelemvor oversees in the afterlife.

In the centre of the room stands a grand altar made of black granite, symbolizing the finality and dignity of death. The altar is surrounded by offerings of candles, flowers, and personal mementos left by worshippers in memory of their departed loved ones. This room also honours [[Gods of the Multiverse|Bhaal, god of murder, and Myrkul, god of death]], whose domains of deaths closely aligns with Kelemvor's oversight of the dead and the afterlife. The solemnity of the room is enhanced by the presence of ethereal lights that cast a gentle, otherworldly glow.

Once a portal to the Neverdeath, the room's magical gateway has been closed to the public due to the Spellplague, which caused the dead to rise and disturbed the natural order. However, the portal is still accessible to [Doomguides](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Doomguide), who use it to quickly reach the Neverdeath for their sacred duties. The closed portal stands as a reminder of the delicate balance between life and death and the responsibilities of those who serve Kelemvor in maintaining this balance.

The head priest of Kelemvorâ€™s room leads rituals that honour the dead, provide comfort to the living, and emphasize the importance of a life well-lived. These ceremonies often involve prayers for the deceased, the lighting of candles, and the recitation of sacred texts that speak of the journey of the soul. The room serves as a place for worshippers to mourn, reflect, and seek guidance on matters of death and the afterlife. Through its sombre design and contemplative atmosphere, the Room of Kelemvor provides a sanctuary of peace, reflection, and respect for the dead within the Temple of Neverwinter.
