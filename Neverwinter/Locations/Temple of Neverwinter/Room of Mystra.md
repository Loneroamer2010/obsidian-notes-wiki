The Room of [[Gods of the Multiverse|Mystra]] in the [[Temple of Neverwinter]] is a mystical and enchanting space dedicated to the goddess of magic. Upon entering, visitors are immediately struck by the room’s otherworldly ambiance, created by the enchanted floor that looks like the night sky, complete with twinkling stars and swirling constellations. This mesmerizing effect mirrors the vast and mysterious nature of magic itself, drawing worshippers into a space where the boundaries between the mundane and the magical blur.

The walls of the room are adorned with arcane symbols and intricate tapestries that depict scenes of spellcasting, magical creatures, and legendary mages. The ceiling is a dome painted with celestial patterns, further enhancing the feeling of being under a magical night sky. In the centre of the room stands a grand altar made of crystal and silver, which catches the light in a dazzling display. This altar is where offerings and rituals to Mystra are performed, surrounded by shelves filled with ancient tomes and magical artefacts. The room also honours [[Gods of the Multiverse|Azuth, god of wizards, and Savras, god of divination and fate]], as their domains closely align with Mystra's overarching influence over magic and knowledge.

These ceremonies emphasize the importance of understanding and respecting the weave of magic that Mystra governs. The room serves as a sanctuary for those seeking to deepen their magical abilities, seek divine insight, or simply revel in the beauty of arcane art.
