The Room of [[Gods of the Multiverse|Shar]] in the [[Temple of Neverwinter]] is a shadowy and sombre sanctuary dedicated to the goddess of darkness and loss. As you enter, the light fades, and the air grows cool, creating an atmosphere of mystery and contemplation. The walls are draped in dark, heavy fabrics that absorb light, and the room is dimly lit by flickering candles and lanterns that cast long, wavering shadows, enhancing the sense of obscurity and introspection.

The floor is covered in black and deep purple mosaics that depict the night sky, creating a celestial path that guides worshippers through the space. At the centre of the room stands a black marble altar, polished to a mirror-like finish, reflecting the candlelight in a hauntingly beautiful way. The altar is adorned with offerings of dark flowers, onyx stones, and other symbols of loss and the night. This room also honours [[Gods of the Multiverse|Leira, goddess of illusion]], whose domain of illusion resonate with Shar's themes of darkness and loss. A quiet weeping can be heard throughout the room, although the source is not locatable.

The head priest of Sharâ€™s room leads rituals that explore themes of sorrow, reflection, and the acceptance of loss. These ceremonies often involve quiet meditation, the burning of incense, and the offering of personal tokens of grief and memory. The room serves as a place for worshippers to confront their deepest fears, mourn their losses, and find solace in the embrace of darkness. Through its sombre design and introspective atmosphere, the Room of Shar provides a sanctuary for those seeking to understand and navigate the shadows within the Temple of Neverwinter.
