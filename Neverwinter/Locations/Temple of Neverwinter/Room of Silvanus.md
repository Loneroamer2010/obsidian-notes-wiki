The Room of [[Gods of the Multiverse|Silvanus]] in the [[Temple of Neverwinter]] is a lush and verdant space dedicated to the god of wild nature. Upon entering, visitors are immediately embraced by the natural beauty and tranquillity that define the room. The air is filled with the scent of fresh foliage and the sounds of rustling leaves, creating a serene atmosphere that honours the untamed wilderness.

The room is adorned with vibrant greenery, from towering trees and hanging vines to blooming flowers and soft moss underfoot. The walls are painted with murals of dense forests, majestic mountains, and flowing rivers, capturing the essence of the natural world. In the centre of the room stands a grand altar made of living wood and stone, surrounded by offerings of plants, fruits, and natural artefacts. This room also honours [[Gods of the Multiverse|Malar, god of the hunt]], reflecting their deep connections to nature and the wilderness.

A unique feature of the Room of Silvanus is its portal, which leads to a small camp on the southwest-most edge of the Neverwinter Wood, north of the Neverwinter River. This camp serves as an extension of the temple, providing a direct link to the wild lands that Silvanus protects. The camp is equipped with a simple altar, set among the trees, where worshippers can perform rituals and offer prayers in the heart of nature. There are also a few tents for those seeking longer shelter, allowing them to immerse themselves in the natural environment.

The head priest of Silvanusâ€™s room leads rituals that celebrate the cycles of nature, the sanctity of life, and the harmony of the natural world. These ceremonies often involve offerings of plants and flowers, prayers for the protection of the wilderness, and meditative walks in the forest. The room serves as a sanctuary for those who seek to connect with nature, find peace in its beauty, and honour the wild spirit of Silvanus. Through its lush design and seamless connection to the natural world, the Room of Silvanus provides a haven of tranquillity, reverence, and natural beauty within the Temple of Neverwinter.
