The Room of [[Gods of the Multiverse|Talos]] in the [[Temple of Neverwinter]] is a formidable and dynamic space dedicated to the god of storms and destruction. As you step inside, you are immediately enveloped by the powerful ambiance created by the enchanted roof, which perpetually displays a raging thunderstorm. The constant flashes of lightning and the deep rumble of thunder create an atmosphere of raw, untamed power, perfectly capturing the essence of Talos.

The walls are adorned with murals depicting dramatic scenes of natural disasters, such as tempestuous seas, violent tornadoes, and erupting volcanoes. The floor is made of dark, rugged stone, giving the room a rugged and primal feel. At the centre of the room stands a massive altar constructed from blackened iron and stone, symbolizing the destructive force of Talos. The altar is surrounded by offerings of broken weapons, charred remains, and other symbols of chaos and destruction. This room also honours [[Gods of the Multiverse|Umberlee, goddess of the sea; Talona, goddess of disease and poison; and Auril, goddess of winter]], as their domains align closely with the themes of natural power and destruction.

The head priest of Talosâ€™s room leads intense and dramatic rituals that call upon the power of storms and chaos. These ceremonies often involve loud chants, drumming, and the symbolic breaking or burning of objects. The room serves as a place for worshippers to confront the destructive forces of nature, seek protection from storms, or embrace the power of chaos in their lives. Through its fierce design and stormy atmosphere, the Room of Talos provides a space where the might of the elements and the inevitability of destruction are both revered and respected within the Temple of Neverwinter.
