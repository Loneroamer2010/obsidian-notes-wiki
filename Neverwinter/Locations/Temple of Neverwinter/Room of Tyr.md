The Room of [[Gods of the Multiverse|Tyr]] in the [[Temple of Neverwinter]] is a solemn and authoritative space dedicated to the god of justice. As you enter, you are greeted by an air of gravitas and order, befitting the god's domain. The first third of the room is filled with rows of shelves containing meticulously organized books on law codes, moral etiquette, and legal precedents from Neverwinter and other important cities. This section serves as a legal library where worshippers and priests alike can study and consult on matters of justice and morality.

The walls of the room are adorned with symbols of balance and fairness, and the floor is made of polished stone, etched with patterns symbolizing justice. At the centre of this legal library stands a simple yet elegant altar made of white marble, symbolizing purity and the unyielding nature of true justice. This altar is where offerings and rituals to Tyr are performed. The priests of Tyr's room are exceptionally well-informed about the legal codes and can offer guidance and counsel on matters of law and ethics.

The remaining two-thirds of the room functions as a portal to [[The Hall of Justice]], creating a direct connection to the greater seat of legal authority and divine justice. This space is reserved for more formal ceremonies and the dispensing of divine judgement, emphasizing Tyr's role as the ultimate arbiter. This room also honours [[Gods of the Multiverse|Ilmater, god of endurance]], as their domain of compassion and bravery align with the pursuit of justice and the upholding of moral law.

The head priest of Tyrâ€™s room leads rituals that emphasize the principles of fairness, righteousness, and accountability. These ceremonies often involve the reading of legal texts, oaths of honesty, and the symbolic weighing of scales. The room serves as a sanctuary for those seeking justice, offering a space for reflection, learning, and the application of moral and legal principles. Through its authoritative design and dual-purpose layout, the Room of Tyr provides a sanctuary of law, order, and divine justice within the Temple of Neverwinter.
