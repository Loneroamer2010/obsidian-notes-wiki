The Leviathan was an infamous pirate vessel that prowled up and down the Sword Coast, striking terror into those that crossed its path. The Leviathan’s captain, [[Captain Harrag|Harrag]], was a fearsome foe to any that met him at sea, and no sailors felt their treasure safe while Harrag was out hunting on the Sea of Swords. Sometime after the eruption of Mount Hotenow, the Leviathan ran aground in northern Neverwinter and punctured its hull. Rather than abandon his ship, Harrag stayed with it as the city’s docks were rebuilt around the ship (part of the general reconstruction efforts of the time). Harrag oversaw the ship’s conversion from a wreck into a thriving inn and tavern. 

### Walking the Planks
The ship is divided into three levels for guests. The first level (“the hold”), entered from the docks, hosts the Beached Leviathan’s kitchen and tavern. The tavern has numerous tables fit for parties of all sizes. The second level (“the quarters”) hosts an inn with 12 rooms of various sizes for rent, and the third level (“the deck”) features private parlour rooms and tables that can be rented for a heftier price. Atop “the deck” is an extra upper cabin that serves as Captain Harrag’s private quarters. The decks’ various levels are accessible via a small spiral staircase at the centre of the ship. In addition, a pulley-operated lift can transport goods between each of the levels via a small shaft that extends through each of the levels. 

The entire ship is decorated with nautically-themed paraphernalia, many of which are trophies from Harrag’s past conquests. The interior of the ship and its furnishing are well crafted, featuring fancy oak and cherry woodwork. However, years of patrons coming, going, and brawling have left the finely crafted interior well-worn.

### Grog and Gangs
The clientèle of the Beached Leviathan are generally a humble, mixed bunch. Any with coin to spend are welcome at the tavern. Frequent patrons include sailors as well as more land-bound residents of Neverwinter. Both staff and patrons frequently use [[Beached Leviathan Slang|nautical slang]] in the tavern (e.g., referring to a drunkard as “ballast” or calling a newcomer a “privateer”). It’s very common for landlubbing visitors to feel a bit lost when it comes to parsing the sailors’ dialect. Gambling and brawling are both frequent occurrences, though the latter is likely to get you promptly tossed off the ship. 

It’s also extremely common to find any number of seedy factions represented at the Beached Leviathan. Commonly sighted at the tavern are smugglers, thieves, and press gangs. To these ilks, the Beached Leviathan serves as an important place of business. Deals are made, trades are performed, and the occasional drunken sailor is enslaved. All of this is relatively well-known to [[Lord Protector Neverember|Lord Neverember]] and his forces, who often also discretely monitor the tavern to keep abreast of the city’s seedy underbelly. Neverember and his watch, however, almost never intercede in these foul dealings, choosing instead to keep the tavern as a reliable source of information.

### Loyal Shipmates
An establishment like the Beached Leviathan couldn’t exist without a fearless captain and a hearty crew to support him. The Beached Leviathan has a colourful collection of staff and regulars that make the location such an interesting place. Becoming a regular at the tavern is likely to earn one an apt, nautically-themed nickname. 
* [[Captain Harrag]]
##### Staff (“Crew”)
* **Andrella.** “Mate” - Andrella is Harrag’s right hand. A middle-aged, human woman, she is the lead barmaid. She leads the staff when Harrag isn’t around and cares very deeply for Harrag. She has developed somewhat of a secret, unrequited love for the Captain. 
* **Feng.** A very large half-orc male, Feng, serves as the tavern’s bouncer. 
* **Tabnab.** An oddball human male, Tabnab is the inn’s cook. 
* **Jyseria** Barmaid
* **Sandrine** Barmaid
* **Willow** Barmaid
##### Regulars
* **Len-jes.** “Harbourmaster” - Len-jes, a female scarred watersoul genasi, is actually the harbourmaster of Neverwinter. She rents a room in the Beached Leviathan semi regularly. 
* **Umi.** “Helmswoman” - Umi, also a female watersoul genasi, is Len-jes’s cousin and serves as backup to **Feng** if a situation at the tavern becomes too rowdy. She’s highly skilled with the sword. 
* **Bobrik Highmantle.** “Bosun” - Bobrik, a stout male dwarf with a pet monkey, is a regular fixture at the bar. He has a fiery temper that occasionally gets him kicked out of the tavern for a few days. 
* **Markul.** “Lookout” - Markul, a young human man, is constantly listening to all the goings-on at the tavern. For the right price, he’s willing to share the secrets he has learned, as long as they aren’t secrets that he perceives would harm the Leviathan. 
* **Ettain.** “Caulker” - Ettain, a half-elf male, works as the ship’s handyman. He’s a skilled carpenter that can repair the ship as well as craft or repair its furniture when needed. He knows every square inch of the ship, including its secrets. 
* **Korin.** “Chanteyman” - Korin, a middle-aged male dragonborn bard, plays music and sings at the tavern. He is often known to get the whole bar singing sea shanties and folk songs. He gladly accepts tips and drinks. His family was slaughtered by cultists, which he will sometimes work into a sorrow-laden dirge.

### Stormy Waters
Throughout its relatively brief history in Neverwinter, the Beached Leviathan has found itself embroiled in conflict well beyond its seemingly-humble station. This is largely because of the type of patronage allowed in the Leviathan, in addition to Lord Neverember’s own involvement with the locale. It was with Neverember’s support and patronage that Harrag was able to create the establishment at all — as Neverember was ultimately the one to expunge the record of his numerous crimes on the high seas. This made Harrag a true Neverember loyalist. Lord Neverember absolutely uses Harrag for his own ambitions. Neverember even went so far as to turn Harrag’s own shadow into a sentient creature used to spy on the facility. 

In 1479, as part of the scuffle over the true heir to the throne of Neverwinter and the lost crown of Alagondar, the Leviathan was attacked by furious Neverwinter members. The Leviathan was only saved because of intervention from adventurers and Neverember’s top general, General Sabine. Later, that same year, Ashmadai cultists and demons infiltrated the Beached Leviathan and killed one of General Sabine’s top advisors. This was ultimately part of a larger plot by a powerful mage named Elden Vargas to use the powers of Asmodeus to his own purposes.
