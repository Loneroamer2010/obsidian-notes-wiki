The Driftwood Tavern Almost more of a museum than a tavern, the upscale and expensive Driftwood Tavern sits in the northern docks area of Neverwinter. The tavern is one of Neverwinter’s older drinking locales — having been in operation since before the [[An Abridged History of Neverwinter|Spellplague of 1385 DR. After the cataclysm of 1451 DR]], the tavern was used to shelter refugees and served as a makeshift city hall while the city regained some semblance of normalcy. 

The establishment is chock-full of bric-a-brac. Rather than viewing the establishment as cluttered or disorganized, however, many view it as a beautiful tribute to “Old Neverwinter” and a vital part of preserving the city’s history. Indeed, many travellers visit the tavern and pay its high prices for drinks and/or lodging simply to enjoy the relics collected at the establishment.

Madame Rosene, now roughly 70 years old, runs the establishment. In 1479 DR, she was secretly the leader of the Sons of Alagondar (i.e., the Graycloaks), a rebel group that opposed [[Lord Protector Neverember|Lord Neverember’s]] rule in the city. The faction, now, has largely made peace with Neverember’s rule, many members even enlisting in Neverwinter’s army (feeling it better that they control their own army rather than continuing to let Mintarn mercenaries have power in the city). Madame Rosene is a fount of knowledge regarding the city’s history and will happily chat about old times with patrons
