The Moonstone Mask is a large inn that sits on a [[The Floating Earthmotes|floating earthmote]] connected to the docks of the Protector’s Enclave section of Neverwinter. It is regarded by many as Neverwinter’s finest, most luxurious inn. The locale is named for the half-masks worn by all of its staff, which are lined with glowing moonstones.

### The Mask’s Staff
One might assume the Moonstone Mask’s impeccable accommodations and unparalleled views are what entices its patrons, but it is actually the Mask’s staff that are the inn’s primary draw. The serving staff are all trained to be expertly-skilled companions as well as friendly and loyal confidants. The staff can be expected to offer erudite conversation and skill in a variety of games. It is this companionship that has made the Moonstone Mask a destination for the people of high rank and wealth for over a century.

While the Moonstone Mask no longer employs only women as its serving staff, all the customer-facing employees are exceptionally attractive. The Moonstone Mask’s staff are all dressed in sheer black, each also wearing the inn’s namesake masks and an amulet. However, these clothing items are no simple uniform. The masks provide the wearer with the abilities of Dark Vision or Infravision, allowing all the staff to gracefully traverse dim or darkened areas of the inn. The amulets, also magical, provide the staff immunity from mind-reading or control — an important quality given how much sensitive information the inn’s companions are entrusted with. The amulets also allow magical communication with the inn’s proprietor using only silent-thought — an important security feature were an employee to ever encounter an unruly or unsavoury guest. 

[[Liset Cheldar]], a half-elf woman, currently serves as the Moonstone Masks’ proprietor. Liset is presumed to be the descendant of the Moonstone Masks’ previous owner, Ophala Cheldarstorn. Unlike Ophala, who was a powerful mage, Liset does not appear to possess such powers. Liset is friendly and known to flirt with guests.

### Mask’s Amenities
The inn features a large, warm, and inviting ground floor dining room. The room also serves as a comfortable lounge with an impressive hearth. The rest of the first floor is taken up by kitchens dedicated to preparing haute cuisine for the inn’s many guests. A grand, spiralling staircase leads up from the dining room to the guest rooms above. The atmosphere of the dining room is generally relaxed, with polite conversations occurring throughout.

Guest rooms occupy the second through fourth floors. The rooms range in size from single-bed studios to large suites on the upper floors. All feature comfortable beds and luscious fur rugs. Guests staying in the inn’s rooms can expect meals to be included with the price of their stay, but alcohol can cost extra. Naturally, the Mask features an impressive selection of fine libations.

For guests travelling through the most elaborate means, the roof features a special landing for winged steeds. It is rumoured the Mask is laden with hidden wall panels that can open up for secretive travel within the inn itself. The staff is said to open these panels by speaking certain magical words. The fifth floor, directly below the penthouse suites, houses a lively festhall with music and dancing. The aforementioned magical soundproofing ensures this doesn’t disturb any of the guests.

### The Mask’s History
The Moonstone Mask was built by Ophala Cheldarstorn, a mage and member of the Many-Starred Cloak. Ophala is also the creator of the magical masks and amulets worn by the staff. Before the Mask was sent floating above Neverwinter, it was rumoured to feature secret entrances where special guests could enter and depart unnoticed. It was also rumoured to have basements that connected to tunnels of dwarven-held areas of the Underdark. In the mid-1400s, DR, the inn drifted into the Sea of Swords after the eruption of Mount Hotenow snapped the inn’s rope tethers. The ropes tethering the inn were eventually replaced by large, sturdy chains, but only after the inn went drifting over the Sea of Swords for months. Even after the Mask was finally returned to Neverwinter, it ultimately attracted too few guests, became insolvent, and shuttered for a few decades. After [[Lord Protector Neverember|Lord Dagult Neverember]] started his “New Neverwinter” movement to begin rebuilding Neverwinter, Liset Cheldar was able to not only convince Neverember that she was the rightful heir of the Moonstone Mask, but also able to have him help fund the restoration of the inn to much of its former glory under Ophala Cheldarstorn. In repayment the inn served to often house Neverember and many of his mercenaries and officers throughout the 1470s and 1480s DR.
