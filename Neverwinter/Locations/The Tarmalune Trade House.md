A trade cartel from the city of Tarmalune has procured a large warehouse complex on the southern docks of Neverwinter. Outside the docks, a large swath of stalls and booths have been set up with goods for sale. The Tarmalune merchants are trying desperately to establish a solid trade presence in the area, largely to counter their rival traders from the city of Lylorn that have recently established a trade route in nearby Luskan.
